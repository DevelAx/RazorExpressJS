# RAZ-JS

**JavaScript (browser) version** of the [Razor-Express (RAZ) view template engine library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raz) (see the documentation there).

>*Note:* debugging information of runtime code errors in the JS version is more stingy because the NodeJS virtual machine is not used in the browser.
